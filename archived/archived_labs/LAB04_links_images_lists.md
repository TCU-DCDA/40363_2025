# Lab 06 – Links, Images, and Lists Enhancement

> Delivery Mode: In-Class Activity (Formative)

Goal: Enrich semantic variety and ensure all media is purposeful.

## Tasks
1. Add a new section: `Resources` with an unordered list of 3 external links (each descriptive; no duplicate domains).
2. Add one internal link from top nav/intro to a lower section ID (add `id` to target heading).
3. Replace any decorative image with CSS background later (for now add an HTML comment `<!-- candidate for CSS background -->`).
4. Add a second figure: includes `<figure>`, `<img>`, `<figcaption>` (caption ≤12 words).

## Link Rules
- External links: `rel="noopener"`.
- No raw URLs as link text.

## Success Criteria
- At least 4 total external links now on the page.
- Internal jump works (click tests in browser).

## Turn‑In
- Updated HTML (v6)

## Stretch
- Add an ordered list explaining a 3‑step process you follow (e.g., researching a topic).
