# Archived Lab Files

This folder contains lab files that were superseded when we implemented the "gentle Git introduction" approach.

## Files Archived and Why:

### `LAB02_git_github_workflow.md`
- **Original:** Lab 2 was Git introduction in Week 1
- **Problem:** Too complex for Day 1 beginners
- **Replaced by:** `LAB02_file_organization_web_concepts.md` (prepares for Git)
- **Git now introduced in:** `LAB03_git_html_foundations.md` (Week 2)

### `LAB03_personal_webpage_foundation.md` 
- **Original:** Lab 3 in the old sequence
- **Problem:** Lab numbering shifted when Git moved to Lab 3
- **Now:** This content is in `LAB04_personal_webpage_foundation.md`

### `LAB04_links_images_lists.md`
- **Original:** Lab 4 in the old sequence  
- **Problem:** Lab numbering shifted
- **Now:** This content is in `LAB05_links_images_lists.md`

### `LAB05_base_css_foundation.md`
- **Original:** Lab 5 in the old sequence
- **Problem:** Lab numbering shifted  
- **Now:** This content is in `LAB06_base_css_foundation.md`

## New Pedagogical Sequence:
1. **Lab 1:** Pure HTML learning (ZIP submission)
2. **Lab 2:** File organization & web concepts (ZIP submission)  
3. **Lab 3:** Git introduction + HTML foundations (First GitHub)
4. **Lab 4:** Personal webpage foundation (GitHub)
5. **Lab 5:** Links, images, lists (GitHub)
6. **Lab 6:** CSS foundation (GitHub)

## Benefits of Change:
- Less cognitive overload in Week 1
- Students understand WHY they need Git before learning it
- Natural progression from file management to version control
- Higher success rate for beginners
