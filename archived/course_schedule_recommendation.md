# Recommendation Based on D2L Course Schedule

## ðŸ“… COURSE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS

Based on your D2L schedule, here's the **optimal approach**:

### Week 1 Learning Sequence:
**Session 1 (Aug 19):** Lab 1 - First HTML & VS Code  
**Session 2 (Aug 21):** Lab 2 - Git & GitHub Workflow

### Why Option A (From Scratch) is Best:

## ðŸŽ¯ PEDAGOGICAL ALIGNMENT

### Session 1 Focus: HTML Fundamentals
- **"What is web development?"**
- **"Introduction to the web"**  
- **HTML structure learning**
- **VS Code workflow**

**Students need to CREATE, not edit** to understand these concepts.

### Session 2 Focus: Git & GitHub
- **"File Management via GitHub"**
- **"Installing and configuring VS Code"** 
- **"File organization and project structure"**
- **Lab 2: Git & GitHub Workflow**

**Lab 2 expects students to bring HTML files from Lab 1** - this confirms Lab 1 should create files.

## ðŸ”— WORKFLOW PROGRESSION

Your Lab 2 specifically says:
> "Prerequisites: Complete Lab 01 (First HTML File & VS Code Workflow) - you'll need HTML files to version control"

This confirms Lab 1 should **create files from scratch**, not edit templates.

## ðŸ“š WEEK 2+ PROGRESSION

- **Week 2:** "HTML Foundations" with semantic elements
- **Week 3:** "Intro to CSS" 
- **Week 4:** "CSS Layout & Design"

This progression makes sense when students **built** their foundation, not just edited it.

## âœ… FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Use Option A: GitHub Repository should support from-scratch creation**

### Why this works best:
1. **Session 1:** Students learn HTML by creating
2. **Session 2:** Students learn Git by versioning their creation
3. **Week 2+:** Students build on their solid foundation
4. **Natural progression** from creation â†’ version control â†’ enhancement

### GitHub Repository should contain:
- **Empty starter** (no pre-made HTML)
- **Simple README** guiding file creation
- **Focus on HTML learning** first, Git workflow second
- **Alignment with Lab 2** expectations

This matches your educational philosophy and course timeline perfectly.
