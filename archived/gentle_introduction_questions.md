# Gentle Introduction Strategy: Questions & Planning

## ðŸŽ¯ UNDERSTANDING YOUR VISION

### Git/GitHub Introduction Timing
1. **When would you formally introduce Git/GitHub?**
   - Lab 2 (Week 1, Session 2)?
   - Lab 3 (Week 2, Session 1)?
   - Later in Week 2?
   - Week 3?

2. **What would trigger the need for Git in students' minds?**
   - Having multiple HTML files to manage?
   - Starting CSS and wanting to track changes?
   - Beginning collaborative work?
   - Working on first project?

### Lab 1 ZIP Submission Details
3. **File structure for ZIP submission?**
   - Just the HTML file?
   - HTML + css/ and images/ folders (even if empty)?
   - Entire project folder structure?

4. **ZIP file naming convention?**
   - `LastName_FirstName_Lab01.zip`?
   - `Lab01_YourName.zip`?
   - Something else?

### Transition Strategy
5. **How would students move their Lab 1 work to GitHub later?**
   - Re-create in new repo?
   - Upload ZIP contents to repo?
   - Use as starting point for next assignment?

6. **Would Lab 2 be pure Git introduction, or Git + new HTML work?**
   - Just learning Git with their Lab 1 files?
   - Git + new HTML features?
   - Git + beginning CSS?

### Course Progression Context
7. **Looking at your schedule, when do students start needing:**
   - Multiple files (HTML + CSS)?
   - Project iterations?
   - Deployment (GitHub Pages)?

8. **When would the "File Management via GitHub" pre-class video be most effective?**
   - Before the Git introduction lab?
   - As prep for their first GitHub assignment?

## ðŸ“š REVIEWING YOUR CURRENT SCHEDULE

From your D2L schedule:
- **Session 1 (Aug 19):** Lab 1 - First HTML
- **Session 2 (Aug 21):** Currently "Lab 2 - Git & GitHub Workflow"
- **Week 2:** "HTML Foundations" 
- **Week 3:** "Intro to CSS"

## ðŸ’­ INITIAL THOUGHTS

**Option A: Delay to Week 2**
- Lab 1: HTML + ZIP submission (gentle start)
- Lab 2: More HTML features + ZIP submission
- Lab 3: Git introduction + move previous work to GitHub

**Option B: Delay to CSS Introduction**
- Lab 1-2: HTML only + ZIP submissions
- Lab 5: Git introduction when CSS makes file management necessary

**Option C: Project-triggered Introduction**
- Labs 1-6: Individual skill building + ZIP submissions
- Project 1: Git introduction when collaborative/iterative work begins

## ðŸ¤” QUESTIONS FOR YOU

**Which feels right for your students and course goals?**

**When do YOU think students will feel the pain point that Git solves?**

**What's the sweet spot between "gentle introduction" and "industry readiness"?**
