# Analysis: Moving Lab 1 from GitHub to D2L ZIP Submission

## ü§î CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FIRST

### 1. Git Introduction Timing
- **When would you introduce Git/GitHub?** 
  - Lab 2 (as currently planned)?
  - Later in the semester?
  - Not at all?

### 2. Submission Format
- **Just the HTML files in a ZIP?** Or entire project folder?
- **File structure requirements?** (folders like css/, images/)
- **Naming conventions for the ZIP file?**

### 3. Feedback Workflow
- **How would you provide feedback?** 
  - Comments in D2L?
  - Download ZIP ‚Üí review ‚Üí written feedback?
  - In-class code review?

### 4. Future Lab Progression
- **Would all labs be ZIP submissions?** Or just Lab 1?
- **When would GitHub enter the picture?**
- **How would students build on their Lab 1 work?**

## üìä IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Lab 1 Changes (Simplified!)
**REMOVES:**
- All GitHub Classroom setup
- Git workflow confusion
- Repository cloning/setup
- Commit message requirements
- GitHub Desktop installation

**KEEPS:**
- VS Code setup and workflow
- HTML creation from scratch
- File organization best practices
- Live Server preview
- Core web development skills

**ADDS:**
- Clear ZIP packaging instructions
- File organization for submission
- Probably simpler and less overwhelming!

## üîÑ LATER LABS IMPACT

### Lab 2 Changes (Currently "Git & GitHub Workflow")
**If Git moves to Lab 2:**
- Becomes "Introduction to Version Control"
- Students bring their Lab 1 HTML files
- More focused Git learning (not mixed with HTML basics)
- Could be more effective pedagogically

**If Git is delayed further:**
- Lab 2 could become "Enhanced HTML" or "CSS Introduction"
- Git introduced when students have more confidence

### Lab 3+ Changes
**Need to consider:**
- How do students iterate on previous work?
- When do they need collaborative features?
- When does version control become valuable to them?

### Project Submissions
**Questions:**
- How would longer projects be submitted?
- When would GitHub become necessary?
- Would final projects still use GitHub Pages?

## üìà POTENTIAL BENEFITS

### For Beginners:
- **Less cognitive overload** in first lab
- **Focus purely on HTML** and VS Code
- **Simpler submission process**
- **Immediate success** without Git confusion

### For Course Flow:
- **Cleaner separation** of HTML vs. Git learning
- **More time** for HTML fundamentals
- **Less troubleshooting** Git issues in Week 1

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL CHALLENGES

### Technical:
- Students lose work more easily (no version control)
- Harder to provide iterative feedback
- File organization becomes more critical

### Pedagogical:
- When/how to introduce modern dev workflows?
- Missing opportunity to normalize version control early
- Industry practices delayed

## üí≠ MY INITIAL RECOMMENDATION

This could actually be **pedagogically superior** for Lab 1! 

**Pros:**
- Students can focus 100% on learning HTML
- Less frustration and technical debt
- More successful first experiences
- Git introduced when students can appreciate its value

**Considerations:**
- Need clear plan for when Git enters
- File organization becomes more important
- Feedback workflow needs design

## üîç NEXT STEPS

Based on your answers to the questions above, I can:
1. **Redesign Lab 1** for pure D2L/ZIP submission
2. **Restructure Lab 2** appropriately 
3. **Map out the full semester progression**
4. **Create new submission guidelines**

**What's your vision for the Git introduction timing and overall workflow?**
