# Lab 01 Student Experience Workflow

## Where Students Find Instructions

### Primary Lab Instructions (Complete & Pedagogical)
- **Location**: `LAB01_first_html_vs_code.md` in your course materials folder
- **Posted in**: D2L Course Content, linked in course schedule
- **Content**: Full instructions, learning outcomes, detailed steps, troubleshooting

### GitHub Repository README (Operational & Minimal)
- **Location**: Student's individual GitHub repository (from GitHub Classroom)
- **Purpose**: Quick reference, getting unstuck, basic workflow
- **Content**: Simplified steps, no pedagogical theory, just "do this"

## Student Flow
1. **In class**: You introduce the lab using the full lab document
2. **At home**: Students reference the GitHub README for quick reminders
3. **When stuck**: Students check the full lab document for details
4. **Questions**: Students ask in class or office hours

## Benefits of This Split
- **Classroom**: Rich pedagogical content with learning objectives
- **Repository**: Focused, actionable steps without cognitive overload
- **Flexibility**: Students can reference appropriate level of detail for their needs

## Implementation Recommendation
Replace the current complex README in your GitHub template repository with the simplified version I created (`simplified_lab01_README.md`).
