# Lab Files Cleanup Summary

## ✅ ARCHIVAL COMPLETE

### Files Moved to `labs/archived_labs/`:
- `LAB02_git_github_workflow.md` (superseded by gentle introduction approach)
- `LAB03_personal_webpage_foundation.md` (renumbered to Lab 4)
- `LAB04_links_images_lists.md` (renumbered to Lab 5)  
- `LAB05_base_css_foundation.md` (renumbered to Lab 6)

### Current Clean Lab Structure:

## 🎯 BENEFITS ACHIEVED

### **Clean Organization:**
- ✅ No duplicate or conflicting lab files
- ✅ Clear numbering sequence
- ✅ Archived files documented with reasons
- ✅ Easy to find current vs. outdated content

### **Pedagogical Improvements:**
- ✅ Gentle Git introduction sequence maintained
- ✅ Labs 1-6 aligned with first 4 weeks of course
- ✅ Clear submission method progression (ZIP → GitHub)
- ✅ Consistent Git workflow from Lab 3 onward

## ⚠️ REMAINING TASKS

### **Future Lab Renumbering:**
The labs after Lab 6 still need renumbering:
- `LAB06_css_typography_polish.md` → `LAB07_css_typography_polish.md`
- `LAB07_flexbox_layout_systems.md` → `LAB08_flexbox_layout_systems.md`
- etc.

**Recommendation:** Update these as you reach each week rather than all at once, to avoid confusion during the semester.

### **Archive Documentation:**
- ✅ `archived_labs/README.md` explains what was moved and why
- ✅ Future instructors can understand the pedagogical decisions
- ✅ Files preserved in case you want to reference old approaches

---
**Status:** First 4 weeks (Labs 1-6) are clean and ready for semester start! 🎉
