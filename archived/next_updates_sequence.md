# Next Updates (Sequenced Checklist)

Status: Labs renumbered so current sequence is:
- LAB03 — Git & HTML Foundations (Week 2)
- LAB04 — Links, Images, and Lists (Week 3)
- LAB05 — Base CSS Foundation (Week 3)
- LAB06 — CSS Typography & Visual Polish (Week 4)

Proceed with the following updates in order.

## 1) Update schedule summary docs
- d2l_schedule_updates_summary.md
  - Session 4 (Week 2): remove “Lab 4: Personal Webpage Foundation”.
  - Session 5 (Week 3): change to “Lab 4: Links, Images, and Lists (labs/LAB04_links_images_lists.md)”.
  - Session 6 (Week 3): change to “Lab 5: Base CSS Foundation (labs/LAB05_base_css_foundation.md)”.
  - Remove/adjust any lines implying LAB06_typography will become Lab 7.
- labs_1-4_weeks_changes_needed.md
  - Replace “Lab 4: Personal Webpage Foundation” with “Lab 4: Links, Images, and Lists”.
  - Replace references to LAB05_links_images_lists.md and LAB06_base_css_foundation.md to the new paths in labs/.

## 2) Align archived references
- labs/archived_labs/README.md
  - Clarify that LAB04_personal_webpage_foundation remains archived and is not used in Week 2–4.
  - Ensure “Now: …” pointers do not conflict with the active labs and new numbering.

## 3) Cross-check links/paths across course pages
- D2L_Course_Schedule.html (Week 3, Week 4) — already updated, but re-verify after step 1.
- Week_2_Resources.html — now only Lab 3; confirmed.
- Week_3_Resources.html — newly added; consider linking it from any index page you share with students.

## 4) Lab README sanity check
- labs/README.md — confirm the numbering matches the active sequence (LAB04, LAB05, LAB06) and that titles match the updated lab files.

## 5) Optional cleanup (defer if mid‑semester)
- lab_cleanup_summary.md — adjust notes that suggest renumbering LAB06_typography to Lab 7; keep it at Lab 6 for this term.
- Remove or annotate any migration notes that could confuse TAs/students.

## 6) Spot-check validations
- Open `labs/LAB04_links_images_lists.md` and `labs/LAB05_base_css_foundation.md` in the browser flow to ensure internal prerequisites point to LAB03 and LAB04 respectively.
- Ensure any in‑document references (e.g., “Before Lab 4” content) match the new lab topics and timing.
