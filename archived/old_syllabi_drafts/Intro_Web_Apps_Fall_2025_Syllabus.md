## Course Overview
An ungraded, project-based introduction to web applications emphasizing audience empathy, accessibility, creative/humanities framing, and incremental improvement. Core stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, version control, light server-side (Glitch), responsive design, accessibility, performance, and maintainability—with AI (ChatGPT or similar) as a collaborative assistant.

Final Outcome: A personal portfolio with 3–4 creative, functional, accessible web projects hosted online.

## Lab Sequence Summary
| Labs | Focus Cluster | Notes (Re-sequenced) |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| 01–03 | Audience & readability fundamentals | Empathy, scan patterns, CRAP |
| 04–05 | Workflow & planning | Git now precedes deploy; early content inventory |
| 06–08 | Semantic/media enrichment & base CSS | Progressive CSS layering before heavy JS |
| JS01–JS02–JS03 | Core JavaScript (events → DOM → fetch) | Inserted Weeks 4,7,9 to align with JS lecture arc |
| 09–10 | Navigation & quality baseline | Nav + site audit foundation |
| 11–13 | Responsive refactor, advanced layout, fluid type | Media queries shifted later for JS focus first |
| 14–15 | Accessible nav patterns; responsive images | Hamburger earlier; images prep for perf |
| 16–18 | Maintainability, deep accessibility, performance | Audit → a11y deep dive → CWV optimization |

### Lab Delivery Modes & Grading Weight
Legend: IC = In-Class, HW = Homework (Summative), HY = Hybrid (Start in class, finish at home), WRK = Workshop / Peer Review (Light), OPT = Optional (Ungraded), SPR = Sprint / Capstone.

| 05 | WRK | Formative | Planning & content inventory collaboration |
| 06 | IC | Formative | Semantic enrichment & media |
| 07 | HY | Summative Lite | Base CSS foundation (finish at home) |
| 08 | IC | Formative | Visual hierarchy micro-pass |
| 09 | HY | Summative Lite | Nav & banner pattern build |
| 10 | WRK | Formative | Peer quality & a11y audit (catch-up) |

## AI Support Guidelines
Use AI for: examples, debugging hints, refactoring suggestions, accessibility copy improvements, performance ideas.  
Do not use AI for: submitting unexamined code, bypassing reading tasks, misrepresenting authored work.  
Always: credit significant AI assistance in a brief comment or README note.

---
## Assessment Philosophy
Ungraded / mastery-style: completion with reflection + iteration quality. Rubric dimensions tracked (not numerically scored): Accessibility, Responsiveness, Maintainability, Performance Awareness, Version Control Hygiene, Reflective Practice.

---
## Key Policies
- **Late Labs:** 48‑hour grace; after that submit but mark as "Late – seeking feedback" (feedback not guaranteed before next lab).
- **Collaboration:** Pair discussion allowed; code you submit must be personally understood.
- **Accessibility:** Follow evolving checklist (updated after Labs 10, 14, 17).

---
## Tools Timeline
- VS Code (Week 5)  
- Git & GitHub Pages (Week 6)  
- Glitch / Replit (Week 10)  
- DevTools Network & Coverage (Weeks 11–12)  
- Lighthouse / axe (Weeks 10 onward)  
- AI Assistant (Week 1 onward, with expanding scope)

---
## Reflection Requirements
Each major milestone (Labs 10, 14, 18, Final) includes a short reflection: what improved, constraints managed, user-first decisions.

---
## Final Project Minimums
- Deployed, responsive, accessible web app.
- Meets performance & a11y baseline (post Lab18 criteria).
- Includes README with: purpose, features, tech, accessibility notes, performance snapshot.

---
**Maintain empathy & user-first framing across every optimization decision.**
