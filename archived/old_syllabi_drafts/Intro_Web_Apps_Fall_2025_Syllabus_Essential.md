# Intro to Web Applications – Fall 2025  
**Essential Path Syllabus (Pared Down Version)**

> This pared‑down syllabus highlights the minimum successful path for first‑time beginners. Use alongside the full syllabus (v2) for optional enrichment items.

**Goal:** Confidently produce an accessible, semantic, responsive front‑end with light JavaScript (events, DOM templating, simple fetch) and solid Git workflow. Performance deep dives, advanced typography, audits, and optimization sprints are *optional*.

---
## Learning Outcomes (Essential)
- Create semantic, accessible HTML structures (landmarks, alt text, headings, lists).
- Design readable, responsive layouts with core CSS (flex, simple media queries, type scaling basics).
- Use Git/GitHub for version control; publish via GitHub Pages.
- Add interactivity with beginner‑friendly JavaScript: events, arrays, rendering templated content into the DOM.
- Fetch and display JSON data with basic error messaging (graceful fallback).
- Apply an accessibility baseline checklist throughout iterations.
- Reflect on user needs and articulate improvements in brief write‑ups.

## Core Labs List
- Labs 01–12 (excluding any designated stretch in full version)
- Lab14 Accessible Navigation
- Lab15 Responsive Images
- Reflection (Final Week)

If you finish all above comfortably, consult full syllabus for next stretch target—choose only one at a time.

---
## Final Project Minimums (Essential)
- Deployed responsive site/app (GitHub Pages; optional simple hosted JSON if provided).
- Accessibility baseline: headings, alt text, color contrast, focus visible, nav landmarks.
- At least one interactive JS enhancement (event-driven or fetched data render).
- README: purpose, audience, features, accessibility notes, two potential future performance ideas.
- Short reflection: What improved most? Where would you iterate next?

---
## Reflection Touchpoints
- After Lab10 (accessibility & readability improvements)
- After Lab15 (responsive images impact & tradeoffs)
- Final (growth narrative + next steps)

---
## Tool Onboarding Order
1. Weeks 1–2: Browser DevTools (Elements, basic contrast check)
2. Week 3: Git local commits
3. Week 6: GitHub Pages deployment
4. Week 7: Simple JS console debugging
5. Week 9: Fetch + network panel basics
6. Week 11: Basic axe scan (awareness only)

---
## Progress Tracking
Maintain a single `checklist.md` marking completion of: semantic structure, navigation, responsive layout, interactive component, fetch usage, accessibility baseline, images optimized, reflections written.
