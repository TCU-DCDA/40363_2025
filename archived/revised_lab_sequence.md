## üìù UPDATED LAB 1 DESIGN

Remove all GitHub references and create clean D2L submission process:

### Lab 1 Changes Needed:
1. **Remove GitHub Repository Setup section entirely**
2. **Add D2L ZIP submission instructions**  
3. **Focus purely on HTML creation and VS Code**
4. **Add file organization prep for future Git work**

### New Lab 1 Structure:

- Create HTML from scratch in organized folder
- Learn Live Server workflow
- Practice good file naming
- Package for submission

Would you like me to redesign Lab 1 with these changes and create the new Lab 2 outline?
