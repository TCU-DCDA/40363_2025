# Learning Dimensions (Descriptive – No Points)
These descriptors guide self‑assessment and feedback. Use commit hashes as evidence.

Bands: Emerging → Developing → Proficient. You can be in different bands per dimension; growth trajectory matters most.

## SEM (Semantic Structure)
- Emerging: Relies on generic <div> / <br>; heading levels out of order; landmark elements missing.
- Developing: Uses appropriate headings and some landmarks (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`); occasional misuse or redundancy.
- Proficient: Clear, hierarchical structure; purposeful landmarks; minimal, meaningful wrappers.

## A11Y (Accessibility Awareness)
- Emerging: Missing alt text; unclear link text; no consideration of reading order.
- Developing: Adds alt text (may be verbose); improves link text; basic color contrast awareness.
- Proficient: Concise, accurate alt; descriptive links; checks keyboard focus and announces structural regions.

## CSSORG (CSS Organization / Reuse)
- Emerging: Inline styles or large unstructured blocks; repeated declarations.
- Developing: External stylesheet; starts grouping; some repetition remains; class names mostly descriptive.
- Proficient: Logical sections (typography, layout, components); DRY utilities or variables; consistent naming pattern.

## ITER (Iteration / Refactoring)
- Emerging: Single large commit near deadline; few/no refactors.
- Developing: Multiple commits across days; at least one improvement-only refactor.
- Proficient: Incremental commit narrative; systematic cleanup passes; responds to feedback with targeted changes.

## COMM (Commit Communication)
- Emerging: Generic messages ("update", "final"). Large multi-purpose commits.
- Developing: Most messages action-oriented; occasional vague or combined changes.
- Proficient: Single-purpose commits named by intent + context ("refactor: improve heading hierarchy").

## Using This Rubric
In bi‑weekly self‑assessment:
1. Select one dimension that advanced a band; cite 2–3 commit hashes.
2. Identify one dimension to focus next; propose a concrete experiment.
3. Summarize how feedback changed your approach (hash before/after).

Growth > static label. Document changes.
