# Lab 02 – File Organization & Web Development Concepts

> Delivery Mode: In-Class Activity (Foundation Building)

Goal: Understand professional web development file management, expand HTML knowledge, and prepare for version control workflows.

## Learning Outcomes
- Master professional file organization for web projects
- Understand the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Learn about web browsers, servers, and how websites work
- Practice multi-page website structure
- Prepare for collaborative development workflows

## Prerequisites
- Completed Lab 01 (First HTML File & VS Code Workflow)
- VS Code configured with recommended extensions
- Understanding of basic HTML structure

## Tasks

### 1. Project Enhancement & Organization
1. **Create a new project folder**: `Lab02_YourLastName`
2. **Copy your Lab 01 work** into this new folder as a starting point
3. **Expand your file structure**:
   ```
   Lab02_YourLastName/
   ├── index.html          ← Enhanced from Lab 01
   ├── about.html          ← New page to create
   ├── css/                ← Still empty but important
   │   └── (future styles)
   ├── images/             ← Add sample images if desired
   │   └── profile.jpg     ← Optional: add your photo
   └── README.txt          ← Project description file
   ```

### 2. Multi-Page Website Structure
1. **Enhance your `index.html`**:
   - Improve content based on Lab 01 feedback
   - Add basic navigation structure (prepare for linking)
   - Ensure semantic HTML5 elements are used properly

2. **Create `about.html`**:
   - Copy the basic structure from index.html
   - Change the title and main content
   - Create 3-4 sections: background, education, interests, goals
   - Practice consistent HTML structure across pages

3. **Add basic navigation**:
   - Simple `<nav>` element in both pages
   - Prepare for linking (we'll activate links in future labs)

### 3. Professional File Management
1. **Implement advanced naming conventions**:
   - Consistent lowercase file names
   - Meaningful, descriptive names
   - Proper file extensions (.html, .css, .jpg, etc.)

2. **Understand relative paths**:
   - How files reference each other
   - Folder structure importance
   - Why organization matters for larger projects

3. **Create a project README.txt**:
   ```
   Project: Personal Website Foundation
   Course: WRIT 40363 - Intro to Web Applications
   Lab: 02 - File Organization & Web Development Concepts
   
   Files included:
   - index.html: Homepage with introduction
   - about.html: Detailed about page
   - css/: Folder for future stylesheets
   - images/: Folder for website images
   
   Notes: This project demonstrates proper file organization
   and multi-page HTML structure.
   ```

### 4. Web Development Concepts Deep Dive
1. **Understanding the Web Stack**:
   - How browsers interpret HTML
   - Where CSS fits in the picture
   - Role of JavaScript (preview)
   - Client vs. server concepts

2. **File Relationships**:
   - How HTML pages link together
   - How CSS will style HTML (preview for next week)
   - How images are embedded
   - Asset management concepts

3. **Professional Workflow Preview**:
   - Why file organization matters in teams
   - How version control fits (preview for Lab 3)
   - Industry standard practices
   - Preparing for deployment concepts

### 5. Quality Assurance & Testing
1. **Cross-page consistency**:
   - Same navigation structure
   - Consistent heading hierarchy
   - Similar footer information

2. **File validation**:
   - Both HTML files validate without errors
   - All file paths work correctly
   - Images display properly (if included)

## Content Requirements

### Enhanced index.html should include:
- Improved content from Lab 01
- Basic navigation structure
- At least 3 semantic sections
- Professional presentation

### New about.html should include:
- **Background section**: Brief personal/academic background
- **Education section**: Current studies and academic interests
- **Interests section**: Hobbies, passions, what drives you
- **Goals section**: What you hope to achieve in this course and beyond

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Project folder properly organized with logical structure
- [ ] Two valid HTML5 documents with proper semantic structure
- [ ] Consistent navigation structure across both pages
- [ ] All files follow naming conventions
- [ ] README.txt file documents the project clearly
- [ ] Both pages display correctly in Live Server
- [ ] Content is meaningful and well-written
- [ ] File organization demonstrates understanding of web project structure

## Submission Instructions
1. **Test both pages:** Ensure both HTML files display correctly
2. **Validate your HTML:** Use W3C validator for both files
3. **Check file organization:** Ensure all files are properly named and organized
4. **Package for submission:**
   - Select your entire project folder (`Lab02_YourLastName`)
   - Create a ZIP file: `LastName_FirstName_Lab02.zip`
   - Verify ZIP contains all required files and folders
5. **Submit to D2L:** Upload your ZIP file to the Lab 02 assignment dropbox

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Use Live Server to test both pages
- Check that file paths are correct (case-sensitive)
- Ensure consistent structure between pages
- Ask questions about web development concepts - understanding the big picture is important!

## Looking Ahead
This organized project structure will be perfect for introducing version control in Lab 3. You'll learn how Git helps manage files like these and why professional developers use it. Your well-organized project will make the transition to Git much smoother!
