# Lab 09 ‚Äì Project Migration & GitHub Pages Deployment

> Delivery Mode: In-Class Tutorial ‚ûú Individual Migration & Deployment (Guided Practice)

Goal: Migrate your completed project from the Sandbox folder to your portfolio root, then deploy to GitHub Pages to establish a live testing environment. This creates a professional web presence ready for Project 1 submission while building confidence with Git deployment workflow.

## Learning Outcomes
- Migrate completed projects from Sandbox to portfolio root directory
- Replace placeholder files with real portfolio content
- Deploy project portfolio to live web server using GitHub Pages
- Configure GitHub Pages for continuous portfolio development
- Establish workflow for testing responsive designs on real devices  
- Create professional web presence ready for project submission
- Build confidence with Git deployment workflow before project deadline

## Prerequisites  
- Completed project in your Sandbox folder with working `practice.html` file
- Portfolio repository with placeholder `index.html` and `about.html` files
- GitHub account with repository already created
- **GitHub Desktop experience** from LAB03 (repository management, commits, push/pull)
- Basic familiarity with commit/push workflow

## üöÄ Getting Started: Building on Your GitHub Desktop Skills

### Quick Skills Review ‚úÖ
You've already learned GitHub Desktop basics in LAB03. Now we'll use those skills for **project migration and deployment**:
- ‚úÖ **Repository management** - you know how to open your portfolio repo
- ‚úÖ **Commit workflow** - you can stage changes and write commit messages  
- ‚úÖ **Push to GitHub** - you can sync your local changes to GitHub.com
- üÜï **New skills:** Migrate projects from Sandbox + Deploy to live website using GitHub Pages

### ‚è∞ Time Estimate: 45-60 minutes
- **Project migration from Sandbox:** 20-25 minutes
- **Repository review and final commit:** 10 minutes
- **GitHub Pages setup:** 10 minutes  
- **Testing and verification:** 15-25 minutes

### üÜò Quick Refresher: GitHub Desktop Workflow
If you need a reminder of the basic workflow from LAB03:
1. **Open GitHub Desktop** ‚Üí Select your portfolio repository
2. **Make changes** to files in VS Code
3. **Review changes** in GitHub Desktop "Changes" tab
4. **Commit** with descriptive message
5. **Push origin** to sync to GitHub.com
6. üÜï **Migrate and Deploy** (new steps we'll learn)

### üÜò Common Issues & Quick Fixes
**Problem:** "Repository not syncing in GitHub Desktop"
- **Solution:** Check internet connection, try "Fetch origin" button, or restart GitHub Desktop

**Problem:** "GitHub Pages not building"  
- **Solution:** Ensure `index.html` is in root directory (not in a subfolder), wait 5-10 minutes

**Problem:** "Site shows 404 error"
- **Solution:** Double-check repository name in URL, verify `index.html` filename (case-sensitive)

**Problem:** "CSS/Images not loading on live site"
- **Solution:** Check that all file paths are relative (`./style.css` not `/absolute/path/style.css`)

## üìã Step-by-Step Migration & Deployment Guide

### Phase 1: Project Migration (Prepare Your Portfolio)

#### Understanding Your Current Setup
Your repository currently has:
- **Placeholder files**: `index.html` and `about.html` in the root (these are outdated templates)
- **Your real project**: Completed work in the `Sandbox/` folder with `practice.html`
- **Goal**: Move your real project to replace the placeholder files

#### Step 1: Backup Your Current Work
1. **Open GitHub Desktop** and select your portfolio repository
2. **Check for any uncommitted changes** in the "Changes" tab
3. **Commit any current work:**
   - Write message: "Backup before project migration"
   - Click **"Commit to main"**
   - Click **"Push origin"** 

#### Step 2: Handle Placeholder Files
1. **Open your repository in VS Code**
2. **Delete the placeholder files**:
   - Right-click `index.html` in the root and delete it
   - Right-click `about.html` in the root and delete it
3. **Note**: These were just template files - your real portfolio content will replace them

#### Step 3: Move Your Project from Sandbox
1. **Navigate to your Sandbox folder** in VS Code's Explorer panel
2. **Locate your completed project folder** (e.g., `project-2`, `personal-website`, etc.)
3. **Right-click the project folder** and select "Cut" (or Cmd+X on Mac)
4. **Navigate to your repository root** (same level as the `images/` folder and `Sandbox/`)
5. **Right-click in the root directory** and select "Paste" (or Cmd+V on Mac)

#### Step 4: Rename Your Main File
1. **Navigate into your moved project folder**
2. **Right-click on `practice.html`** and select "Rename"
3. **Change the name to `index.html`**
4. **Confirm the rename**

#### Step 5: Choose Your Portfolio Structure
You have two options:

**Option A: Single Project Portfolio** (Simpler)
- Your project's `index.html` becomes your main portfolio page
- Works well if showcasing one main project

**Option B: Multi-Project Portfolio** (For multiple projects)
- Create a new `index.html` in the root as a portfolio landing page
- Link to individual project folders
- Example: Root `index.html` ‚Üí links to `project-1/`, `project-2/`, etc.

#### Step 6: Update File Paths (If Needed)
1. **Open your project's `index.html`**
2. **Check all internal links** (CSS files, images, other HTML pages)
3. **Update any broken paths** - file locations may have changed
4. **Test links to images** - they should still work if using relative paths

#### Step 7: Commit Your Migration
1. **Return to GitHub Desktop**
2. **Review all changes** in the "Changes" tab
3. **Write commit message**: "Migrate [project-name] from Sandbox to portfolio root"
4. **Click "Commit to main"**
5. **Click "Push origin"**

### Phase 2: GitHub Pages Deployment

### Phase 2: GitHub Pages Deployment

#### Using GitHub Desktop (Building on LAB03 Skills)

Since you already know GitHub Desktop from LAB03, this will be familiar:

#### Step 1: Final Portfolio Review
1. **Open GitHub Desktop** and select your portfolio repository
2. **Verify your migration:** Check that your project files are now in the root
3. **Test locally:** Open your `index.html` file to ensure everything works
4. **Make any final adjustments** if needed

#### Step 2: Final Commit Before Deployment
1. **Review any final changes** in GitHub Desktop's "Changes" tab
2. **Commit final changes:**
   - Write message: "Ready for deployment - project migrated to root"
   - Click **"Commit to main"**
   - Click **"Push origin"**

#### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Web Interface)
1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Navigate to your repository** 
3. **Click "Settings" tab** (should be at the top of your repository)
4. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar menu
5. **Under "Source"** select **"Deploy from a branch"**
6. **Select "main" branch** and **"/ (root)"** folder
7. **Click "Save"**

#### Step 3: Get Your Live URL
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Refresh the GitHub Pages settings page**
3. **Copy your live URL** - it will look like: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`
4. **Bookmark this URL** - you'll use it for testing in future labs

### Alternative: Using VS Code (If you prefer VS Code over GitHub Desktop)

If you're comfortable with VS Code's built-in Git features:

1. **Open your portfolio folder in VS Code**
2. **Save any changes** you've made to your files
3. **Click the Source Control icon** (looks like a branch) in the left sidebar
4. **Review your changes** in the Source Control panel
5. **Type a commit message** like "Ready for deployment"
6. **Click the checkmark** to commit
7. **Click "Sync Changes"** to push to GitHub
