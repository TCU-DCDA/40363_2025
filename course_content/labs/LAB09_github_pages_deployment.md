## üöÄ Getting Started: Building on Your GitHub Desktop Skills

### Quick Skills Review ‚úÖ
You've already learned GitHub Desktop basics in LAB03. Now we'll use those skills for **deployment**:
- ‚úÖ **Repository management** - you know how to open your portfolio repo
- ‚úÖ **Commit workflow** - you can stage changes and write commit messages  
- ‚úÖ **Push to GitHub** - you can sync your local changes to GitHub.com
- üÜï **New skill:** Deploy to live website using GitHub Pages

### ‚è∞ Time Estimate: 30-45 minutes
- **Repository review and final commit:** 10 minutes
- **GitHub Pages setup:** 10 minutes  
- **Testing and verification:** 15-25 minutes

### üÜò Quick Refresher: GitHub Desktop Workflow
If you need a reminder of the basic workflow from LAB03:
1. **Open GitHub Desktop** ‚Üí Select your portfolio repository
2. **Make changes** to files in VS Code
3. **Review changes** in GitHub Desktop "Changes" tab
4. **Commit** with descriptive message
5. **Push origin** to sync to GitHub.com
6. üÜï **Deploy** using GitHub Pages (new step we'll learn)

### üÜò Common Issues & Quick Fixes
**Problem:** "Repository not syncing in GitHub Desktop"
- **Solution:** Check internet connection, try "Fetch origin" button, or restart GitHub Desktop

**Problem:** "GitHub Pages not building"  
- **Solution:** Ensure `index.html` is in root directory (not in a subfolder), wait 5-10 minutes

**Problem:** "Site shows 404 error"
- **Solution:** Double-check repository name in URL, verify `index.html` filename (case-sensitive)

**Problem:** "CSS/Images not loading on live site"
- **Solution:** Check that all file paths are relative (`./style.css` not `/absolute/path/style.css`)

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Using GitHub Desktop (Building on LAB03 Skills)

Since you already know GitHub Desktop from LAB03, this will be familiar:

#### Step 1: Final Portfolio Commit
1. **Open GitHub Desktop** and select your portfolio repository
2. **Review your LAB08 changes:** Check "Changes" tab for any uncommitted work
3. **Commit final changes:**
   - Write message: "Complete LAB08 grid layouts - ready for deployment"
   - Click **"Commit to main"**
   - Click **"Push origin"** (same workflow as LAB03)

#### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages (Web Interface)
1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Navigate to your repository** 
3. **Click "Settings" tab** (should be at the top of your repository)
4. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar menu
5. **Under "Source"** select **"Deploy from a branch"**
6. **Select "main" branch** and **"/ (root)"** folder
7. **Click "Save"**

#### Step 3: Get Your Live URL
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Refresh the GitHub Pages settings page**
3. **Copy your live URL** - it will look like: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`
4. **Bookmark this URL** - you'll use it for testing in future labs

### Command Line Alternative (For Students Comfortable with Terminal)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/portfolio

# Check repository status  
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Deploy portfolio to GitHub Pages"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Tasks

### 1. Repository Preparation
1. **Clean Up Repository Structure:**
   ```
   your-repo/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          (main page)
