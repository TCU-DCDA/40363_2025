# Lab 02 – Scanability Pass

> Delivery Mode: In-Class Activity (Formative)

Goal: Improve the Lab 01 page so it can be scanned in under 5 seconds.

## Tasks
1. Open your existing `about.html`.
2. Add one concise lead sentence (bold) at top of main content.
3. Break any wall-of-text paragraph into 2 shorter paragraphs (≤50 words each).
4. Convert a comma list (if present) into a proper `<ul>`.
5. Add one additional meaningful subheading (`h2` or `h3`).

## Scanability Checklist
- Clear visual entry point (lead bold sentence or strong first line).
- No paragraph > 70 words.
- Hierarchy: h1 then h2/h3 only (no skipped levels).
- Lists used where enumeration helps.

## Success Criteria
- Page conveys who you are + key interest pillars in ≤5s of eye scanning.
- Headings are descriptive, not “Introduction”.

## Turn‑In
- Updated `about.html` (version 2)

## Stretch
- Add a short definition list `<dl>` for 2–3 terms (Term + Definition) relevant to you (e.g., skills, tools).
