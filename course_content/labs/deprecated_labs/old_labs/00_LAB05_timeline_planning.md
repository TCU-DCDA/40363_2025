# Lab 05 – Project Timeline & Content Inventory

> Delivery Mode: In-Class Workshop (Planning / Peer Collaboration)

Goal: Plan incremental enhancements and catalog existing content blocks.

## Tasks
1. Create `planning/` folder.
2. Add `content_inventory.md`: table with columns (Block, Purpose, Status, Notes) listing each section, list, figure, image.
3. Add `roadmap.md`: 5 upcoming improvements (one sentence each) ordered by priority.
4. Tag each backlog item with a label: `accessibility`, `design`, `content`, or `structure`.

## Inventory Rules
- Include every distinct structural element (each list counts as one block).
- Purpose is user-facing (e.g., “Quickly convey core interests”).

## Success Criteria
- Inventory lists ≥8 blocks.
- Roadmap items are actionable, not vague (avoid “Improve design”).

## Turn‑In
- `planning/content_inventory.md`
- `planning/roadmap.md`

## Stretch
- Add a column “Metric” with how you might measure success for 2 items (e.g., scroll depth, time to comprehension).
