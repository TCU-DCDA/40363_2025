# Lab 10 – Quality & Accessibility Check

> Delivery Mode: In-Class Peer Review / Catch-Up Day (Light Submission)

Goal: Perform a structured self‑audit before moving to next module.

## Tasks
1. Create `audit.md`.
2. Headings: Overview, Structure, Content, Design, Accessibility, Next Steps.
3. For each section list 2–4 bullet observations (positive or issues) + one action.
4. Run a browser accessibility tool (e.g., Lighthouse) – capture top 2 issues in Accessibility section.
5. Check contrast of primary text and link hover vs. WCAG (record ratios if available).
6. Validate HTML (copy/paste into a validator) – note any errors/warnings.

## Accessibility Minimums
- All images have meaningful alt OR empty alt if decorative.
- Headings nested semantically (no jump from h1 to h4).
- Focus outline remains visible (not removed).

## Success Criteria
- `audit.md` has ≥12 total bullet points across categories.
- At least 3 concrete next steps prioritized.

## Turn‑In
- `audit.md`

## Stretch
- Add a small table summarizing key metrics (Words, Images, External Links, Internal Links, Sections).
