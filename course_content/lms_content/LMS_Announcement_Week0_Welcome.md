# Welcome to Intro to Web Applications! üåê

Hey everyone! Welcome to what I hope will be an exciting and empowering semester. I'm thrilled you're here, and I want to start by saying: **you belong in this class**, regardless of your background with technology.

## This Course is Designed for YOU
This course assumes **zero prior coding experience**. Seriously. If you can browse social media and use a word processor, you have all the technical skills needed to start. We'll build everything from the ground up, together.

**What makes this different from a typical CS course:**
- No complex math or abstract algorithms
- Focus on practical, real-world skills
- Writing and design thinking are just as important as coding
- Everyone learns at their own pace

## What We're Building Together
By the end of this semester, you'll have created a **professional personal website** that you can actually use for job applications, graduate school, or just to showcase your interests. Here's our journey:

1. **Weeks 1-3:** HTML fundamentals - giving your content structure
2. **Weeks 4-6:** CSS design - making it look professional and work on all devices  
3. **Weeks 7-9:** Basic JavaScript - adding some interactive features
4. **Weeks 10-15:** Putting it all together with real data and polished interactions

**No confusing frameworks, no overwhelming technical jargon** - just solid fundamentals that will serve you well.

## Why This Matters for Your Studies & Future
Whether you're in **Writing, English, Communications, Digital Culture, Data Analytics,** or any other field:

- **Critical thinking:** Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Communication:** Presenting information clearly for different audiences
- **Professional skills:** Understanding how digital content actually works
- **Creative expression:** Having control over how your ideas are presented online
- **Future-proofing:** Digital literacy that's increasingly essential in every field

## Week 1: Getting Started (Low Pressure!)
**In our first class:** We'll talk about how you read and navigate websites - you're already an expert user!

**Your first assignment:** Create a simple "About Me" page using just HTML (no design yet). Think of it like creating a structured document - headings, paragraphs, lists. That's it.

**Due:** Lab 1 by Sunday 11:59 PM (and yes, we'll walk through this together)

## Our Weekly Rhythm
Here's what a typical week looks like:
- **Tuesday:** Learn a new concept with hands-on practice
- **Thursday:** Apply it to your own project with guided support
- **Weekend:** Complete a short lab to reinforce what we learned

**Time commitment:** About 4-6 hours per week total (including class time). If you're spending significantly more, please reach out - we'll figure out how to make it manageable.

## Before Our Next Class
1. **Create a course folder** on your computer (name it something like "Web-Dev-Course")
2. **Skim the syllabus** - don't stress about memorizing everything, just get familiar
3. **Think about your goals:** What would you want your personal website to say about you?
4. **Bring curiosity:** What's one thing you've always wondered about how websites work?

## Tools We'll Use (Gradually!)
**Week 1:** Just your web browser and a simple text editor
**Later:** VS Code (free, user-friendly), GitHub (for saving and sharing work)
**Much later:** Some JavaScript for interactive features

We introduce tools only when you need them, with full tutorials.

## AI Tools Policy (Realistic & Helpful)
**Encouraged for:** Getting unstuck, understanding error messages, brainstorming content ideas
**Not helpful for:** Having AI write code you don't understand - you'll miss the learning

**My approach:** If AI helps you learn something, great! Just add a comment explaining what you learned.

## Success Looks Like...
**Week 1 goal:** Create a basic HTML page with your name, a few paragraphs about yourself, and proper headings. 
**That's genuinely enough to be successful in Week 1.**

**Semester goal:** A professional website you're proud to share, plus confidence that you can learn technical skills when you need them.

## When Things Feel Challenging
**Remember:** Everyone in this class is learning something completely new. It's normal to feel confused sometimes.

**My promise:** I'll never assume you know something we haven't covered together.

**When to ask for help:** After you've tried for 15-20 minutes. Seriously. Send me a screenshot or copy the error message - I can usually get you unstuck quickly.

**If you fall behind:** Focus on completing the current week's work first. Don't try to catch up on everything at once.

## Let's Do This!
I'm genuinely excited to see what you create this semester. Every professional web developer started exactly where you are now, and you have everything you need to succeed.

Your first "rough draft" website is going to be amazing precisely because it's authentic and represents your learning journey.

See you in class!
