# Welcome to Intro to Web Applications – Fall 2025

Hi everyone,

I’m really glad you’re here. This letter is a calm, honest guide to what you can expect this semester—what we’ll learn, how the workload feels week‑to‑week, and how to take care of yourself while making real progress. If you’ve never written a line of code: you are *exactly* who this course is for.

---
## What We’ll Learn (Essential Track)
We focus on a small, durable toolkit:

| Area | What You’ll Actually Do |
|------|-------------------------|
| HTML | Structure pages with meaningful tags (headings, lists, sections, alt text). |
| CSS  | Make things readable & responsive: spacing, basic layout (flex), simple media queries, type scaling basics. |
| JavaScript (Weeks 7+) | Add small interactions: respond to clicks/inputs, build simple lists from data, fetch external JSON, display errors gently. |
| Git & GitHub | Save changes, write meaningful commits, publish your site publicly using GitHub Pages. |
| Accessibility | Build with keyboard and screen reader considerations from the start (contrast, structure, focus). |
| Reflection | Explain *why* you made certain choices—audience, clarity, improvement. |

### Stretch (Optional Only When You Feel Ready)
- Performance tuning & audits
- Advanced responsive typography (`clamp()`)
- Deep accessibility remediation & ARIA patterns
- CSS reduction & optimization sprints

You can have a successful semester *without* doing any stretch items.

---
## What We Will **Not** Do
- Frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- Complex backend engineering
- Databases or authentication systems
- Fancy build tools (Webpack, Vite)
- Memorization quizzes

---
## Time Commitment (Realistic)
| Activity | Typical Weekly Range |
|----------|----------------------|
| In‑class sessions | ~3 hours (2 meetings) |
| Core lab work | 2–3 hours |
| Project iteration (once you have one) | 1–2 hours |
| Reflection / polish (weeks with a checkpoint) | 30–45 min |
| Catch‑up / review (if needed) | 0–1 hour |

Average steady week: **5–7 focused hours total** (including class time). Some early weeks are lighter; planning and first JavaScript weeks may feel slightly heavier. If you consistently exceed 8 hours, contact me—we’ll adjust scope.

---
## A Typical Week (After Week 2)
1. In class: new concept with a short guided example.
2. You apply it immediately to your project or lab scaffold.
3. Midweek: commit early progress (even if messy).
4. End of week: finish the core lab, push, note one improvement idea.
5. Sunday: submit link + short reflection prompt answer (if assigned).

---
## Your Progress Ladder
You’ll see the same cycles repeatedly:
> Structure → Make readable → Make responsive → Add a tiny interaction → Check accessibility → Reflect

Repeating this loop builds confidence without cramming.

---
## Using AI Assistants Responsibly
**Helpful for:** examples, debugging hints, wording alt text, brainstorming variable names, summarizing your own code.

**Not okay for:** dumping in a feature without reading it, pretending generated code is yours, skipping think‑time.

If AI meaningfully shaped code or content, leave a short comment: `// Assisted by AI: generated initial fetch error handling block`.

---
## How You’ll Know You’re On Track
By Week 3: You can structure a page with good headings & alt text.

By Week 6: You have a live site on GitHub Pages with navigation & readable layout.

By Week 9: You can fetch JSON and show a friendly message if things fail.

By Week 12: Your images adapt to screen size and don’t break layout.

By Week 16: Your final app is accessible, responsive, and clearly explained in a README.

If one of those checkpoints slips, we triage—no shame, just strategy.

---
## When to Ask for Help
Ask early if:
- You’ve stared at something for 20 minutes without a new idea.
- A lab instruction doesn’t make sense after a re‑read.
- Git feels like magic (we’ll demystify it). 
- Error messages feel like another language (we can translate together).

Early questions save you hours.

---
## Mindset Tips
- **Small commits > heroic late pushes.**
- **Readable beats clever.** A future you (and teammates) will thank present you.
- **Guess → test → adjust** is a valid pattern. You do *not* have to “just know.”
- **Delete freely.** Refactoring is progress, not failure.
- **Celebrate micro-wins:** first alt text written, first media query working, first fetch rendering data.

---
## If You Fall Behind
Pick the *current* week’s core lab first. Don’t backfill stretch content while stressed. After stabilizing, choose **one** stretch topic only if you have energy.

---
## Final Project (Plain Version)
You’ll build a small site/app that:
- Has clear purpose/audience
- Works on phone & laptop
- Includes at least one interactive JS feature
- Respects accessibility baseline
- Is deployed & explained in a README

Perfection is not required. Clarity + iteration is.

---
## Your Success Formula
Consistency > intensity. Show up, try the examples, push imperfect code, reflect briefly, repeat.

I’m excited to see what you build—even the messy beginnings. Reach out anytime; you are absolutely capable of this.

See you in Week 1,

*Instructor*
