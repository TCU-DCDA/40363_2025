# Welcome – Intro to Web Applications (Essential + Major Connections)

Hi everyone,

This is a short, plain‑language guide to what this course gives you if you’re coming from:
- **Writing / English** (rhetoric, narrative, audience)
- **Digital Culture & Data Analytics (DCDA)** (structured information, user experience, data meaning)

You do **not** need prior coding.

## What We Actually Do
| Area | In This Class | Why It Matters to Writing / English | Why It Matters to DCDA |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|
| HTML | Give text structure & meaning (headings, lists, landmarks, alt text). | Like organizing an essay: hierarchy, clarity, accessible narrative flow. | Clean structure = machine‑readable, easier to transform/analyze later. |
| CSS | Make content readable, scannable, responsive. | Visual rhetoric: emphasis, pacing, hierarchy on screen. | Interface usability → better engagement, lower cognitive friction. |
| JavaScript | Small interactions: buttons, lists built from data, simple fetch. | Interactive storytelling, adaptive presentation. | Data → interface pipeline; practice thinking in data → view transformations. |
| Accessibility | Ensure everyone can navigate & perceive content. | Inclusive audience strategy (real applied rhetoric). | Ethical design + compliance mindset for real digital products. |
| Fetching JSON | Pull structured data and render it. | Turning raw info into narrative context for readers. | Core pattern in data-driven dashboards & tools. |
| Git/GitHub | Version history & publishing. | Mirrors drafting & revision cycles; evidence of process. | Collaboration & reproducibility baseline. |
| Reflection | Explain choices & next steps. | Metacognition: rhetorical intent, revision. | Iterative improvement lens used in analytics projects. |

---
## Skills You Take Away
- **Audience translation:** turning messy data or ideas into structured, readable artifacts.
- **Narrative via layout:** hierarchy & pacing through semantic markup + CSS.
- **Ethical access:** embedding accessibility as default, not add‑on.
- **Light data literacy:** fetch → parse → present (human layer over raw info).
- **Tool fluency:** version control as disciplined iteration.
- **Self‑explanation:** concise rationale for design decisions.

## Time & Workload (Realistic Core Path)
| Weekly Element | Typical Time |
|----------------|--------------|
| Class meetings | ~3 hrs |
| Lab (core) | 2–3 hrs |
| Project touch (after Week 4) | 1 hr |
| Reflection (select weeks) | 15–30 min |

Steady total: ~5–7 hours including class. If you’re regularly above 8, reach out.

## Milestone Feel (Plain Checkpoints)
| By | You Can |
|----|---------|
| Week 3 | Build a clearly structured, readable page. |
| Week 6 | Publish a small multi‑page site (nav + readability). |
| Week 9 | Fetch and display a list of items with fallback message. |
| Week 12 | Serve properly sized images (no layout break). |
| Week 16 | Ship a small, accessible, responsive final app + written rationale. |

## How It Connects to Your Major
### Writing / English
- Structural markup = rhetorical scaffolding.
- CSS decisions = visual argument (what’s salient). 
- Accessibility = inclusive authorship.
- JS interaction = reader agency / adaptive narrative.
- Reflections = critical commentary on your own text-as-interface.

### Digital Culture & Data Analytics
- Semantic HTML = structured content ready for scraping, indexing, analysis.
- Fetch + render = micro model of data pipeline to interface.
- Accessibility & performance awareness = foundational quality dimensions.
- Version control = provenance & reproducibility.
- Reflection = interpretive layer; meaning‑making from technical choices.

---
## If You’re Nervous About Code
Think of code here as *applied formatting + structured reasoning*:
- HTML is outline + document roles.
- CSS is editorial style sheet.
- JavaScript is transformation: take data → reorder / filter → show.

---
## When to Ask for Help
Ask early if you:
- Struggle to choose the “right” HTML tag.
- Can’t explain what a CSS rule is affecting.
- Don’t know where JavaScript should target the page.
- See an error twice and still feel lost.

Early question = time saved + less stress.

---
## Final Project (Minimal Definition)
A small site/app that:
- Has a clear audience & purpose statement.
- Works on phone & laptop.
- Includes one interactive JavaScript behavior (filter, generator, dynamic list, etc.).
- Meets accessibility baseline (headings, alt text, contrast, keyboard navigation).
- Includes a short README: problem, audience, features, two future improvements.

Stretch only if you *want* (performance audit, advanced layout, deeper a11y pattern).

---
## Simple Success Loop
Structure → Make it readable → Add a tiny interaction → Check access → Write 2–3 sentence reflection → Repeat.

That loop = growth.

---
## Quick Glossary (Plain Words)
| Term | Plain Meaning |
|------|---------------|
| Semantic | Describes meaning, not just appearance. |
| Responsive | Adjusts to screen size without breaking. |
| Fetch | Ask a server for data. |
| DOM | The page’s live structure your JS can change. |
| Commit | Save a snapshot with a short message. |
| Alt Text | Short description for images (screen readers, fallback). |

## Final Encouragement
You are *already* bringing valuable skills: reading nuance, shaping narrative, interpreting data. We’re just adding a new medium. Consistency beats intensity. Start small, stay curious, ask early.

See you soon,
