## Part C — Short Answer (3 × 3 pts = 9 pts)
16) Sample: A clear heading hierarchy communicates document structure to assistive technologies and users, improving navigation (e.g., by screen readers) and readability. It also helps SEO and consistent styling.

17) Sample: Use `<ol>` for ordered, step‑based or ranked items (e.g., “Recipe steps”). Use `<ul>` for unordered collections (e.g., “Favorite hobbies”).

18) Sample: `rel="noopener"` prevents the newly opened page from gaining access to the `window.opener` object, mitigating tabnabbing and improving performance/security when using `target="_blank"`.

## Part D — Code Reading & Fix (2 pts total)
19) Accept any one valid correction. Examples:
- Add language to root element: change `<html>` → `<html lang="en">`
- Correct heading levels: change `<h3>My Portfolio</h3>` → `<h1>My Portfolio</h1>` and change section `<h1>Projects</h1>` → `<h2>Projects</h2>`
- Remove invalid tag inside `<head>` (if present): delete stray `<html lang="en">` within `<head>`

Award 1 pt for a correct, relevant fix (any one). If multiple correct fixes are provided, still 1 pt.

20) C  
21) B

Grading notes
- Part C: award up to 3 pts per response for correctness, clarity, and relevance (2–3 concise sentences are sufficient).
- Minor spelling/grammar errors should not reduce points if the technical meaning is clear.
- For Part D (Q19), many fixes are acceptable as long as they improve semantics or structure (e.g., moving meta tags into `<head>`, adding missing attributes, correcting heading levels).
