# Intro to Web Applications - Fall 2025
**Course 40363 - Student Guide**

## 🌐 Course Workflow
- **LMS (D2L)** = official source for calendar, policies, due dates, reflections, final evaluation
- **GitHub Classroom** = code workspace (starter files, commits, feedback, revision history)

## 🎯 Ungrading – What Counts as Evidence
You are not chasing points; you are building evidence of learning:
- **Process**: spaced, intentional commits over multiple days (target ≥3 commits across ≥2 days per lab)
- **Product**: improvements to semantic HTML, accessibility, CSS organization, layout
- **Reflection**: weekly micro reflection + bi‑weekly self‑assessment referencing commit hashes
- **Feedback Use**: acting on instructor / peer comments (before → after change)

Dimensions we'll reference (see `RUBRIC.md` in course admin): SEM, A11Y, CSSORG, ITER, COMM.

## 🗓 Weekly Rhythm (Tue / Thu – 80 min)
- **Mon (light pre‑work)**: accept assignment + first trivial commit
- **Tuesday class**: scaffold → core build → improvement pass
- **Wed**: midweek commit + 3‑question micro reflection (LMS)
- **Thursday class**: enhancement + peer quick review + polish commit
- **Weekend (optional)**: refinement + (bi‑weekly) self‑assessment

## ✅ Minimum Healthy Process Signals
- ≥3 commits over ≥2 calendar days
- At least one "improvement only" or refactor commit (semantics, a11y, cleanup)
- Commit messages show intent (not just "update")
- Reflections cite commit hashes (e.g., `abc1234`)

## 🚀 Student Quickstart (First Assignment)
1. Click the GitHub Classroom invitation link (in LMS) → Accept → Wait for your private repo
2. Open repo (GitHub Desktop or VS Code) and clone locally
3. Open `README` inside the assignment, follow setup instructions
4. Make a tiny change (e.g., add your name in a comment) → commit: `chore: add name placeholder` → push
5. Build core structure in class → commit: `feat: scaffold page structure with header/main/footer`
6. Midweek improvement → commit: `refactor: improve heading hierarchy + add alt text`
7. End‑week polish → commit: `style: tighten spacing + improve link contrast`
8. Submit reflection in LMS citing 2 commits you're proud of

If stuck >20 minutes: create a "Blocker" note (issue or reflection line) describing what you tried.

## 🧭 Feedback Style
Comments focus on leverage: Observation → Impact → Next experiment.
We cap general comments to avoid overload; ask clarifying questions anytime.
