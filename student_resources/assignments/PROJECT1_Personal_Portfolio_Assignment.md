## Project Overview

You will create a professional personal portfolio website that showcases your skills, interests, and work using the HTML, CSS, and web development techniques we've covered in the first six weeks of class. This project demonstrates your mastery of semantic HTML, CSS layout systems, responsive design, and accessibility best practices.

Your portfolio will serve as both a demonstration of your technical skills and a platform to present yourself professionally online.

1. **Structure content** using semantic HTML elements and proper document hierarchy
2. **Apply CSS styling** including typography, color, spacing, and layout systems
3. **Create responsive designs** that work across different screen sizes and devices
4. **Implement accessibility features** following WCAG guidelines and best practices
5. **Organize and manage** a web development project using proper file structure
6. **Deploy a website** using Git/GitHub workflow and GitHub Pages
