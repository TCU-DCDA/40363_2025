# Weekly Micro Reflection (≈3–4 minutes)
Paste two commit hashes when prompted.

1. Improvement Highlight: What specific improvement did you make since your first commit this week? (Hash + short description)
2. Blocker & Strategy: Describe one obstacle and what you tried to resolve it. (If none, describe a near-miss or small confusion.)
3. Next Experiment: One focused goal for next week (verb + target), e.g., "Refactor duplicate button styles into a reusable class."

# Bi‑Weekly Self‑Assessment (Longer Cycle)
1. Dimension Growth: Which rubric dimension moved forward? Cite 2–3 commit hashes and explain why they show change.
2. Feedback Applied: One instructor/peer comment you acted on. Show before/after (hashes or description).
3. Process Health: How many days did you commit? (List dates.) Is spacing sufficient? If not, plan to adjust.
4. Focus Dimension Next: Which dimension will you target? Concrete experiment statement.
5. Confidence (1–5) & One Action to Raise It by 1.

# End-of-Term Narrative (Synopsis)
1. Early Misconception → Current Understanding (evidence hashes)
2. Most Transformative Habit you formed.
3. Evidence List: 5 commit hashes spanning the term illustrating growth arc.
4. Proposed Overall Evaluation (bands + rationale).

## Tips
- Use short, concrete language.
- Cite commit hashes: `abc1234` format.
- If you batch work, note what prevented spacing and plan a change.
